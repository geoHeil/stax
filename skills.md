# Stax Skills for AI Coding Agents

This document teaches AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, pi) how to use `stax` to manage stacked Git branches and PRs.

> Installing this skill: run `stax skills update` (or `st setup --install-skills`). Per-agent setup details live in `docs/integrations/`.

## What is Stax?

Stax manages stacked branches: small focused branches layered on top of each other. Each branch maps to one PR targeting its parent branch.

## Core Concepts

- **Stack**: A chain of branches where each branch builds on its parent
- **Trunk**: The main branch (`main` or `master`)
- **Parent**: The branch a stacked branch is based on
- **Tracked branch**: A branch with stax metadata (parent and PR linkage)

## Command Map

```bash
stax status|ls                # Stack status (tree)
stax ll                        # Stack status with PR URLs/details
stax log|l                     # Stack status with commits + PR info
stax gui [path]                # Launch fresh native macOS GUI preview for one repository

stax submit|ss                 # Submit full stack
stax stack link                # Register current PR stack as native GitHub Stack (GitHub + gh-stack)
stax stack unlink <stack-number> # Unstack a native GitHub Stack remotely; omit number for active local tracking
stax merge                     # Merge PRs from stack bottom upward
stax sync|rs                   # Sync trunk + clean merged branches
stax sweep                     # Classify + optionally delete merged/gone/stale branches
stax restack                   # Rebase branch/stack onto parents
stax cascade                   # Restack bottom-up and submit updates (no trunk fetch; offline-friendly)

## High-Value Commands and Flags

### Contributor Release Workflow

```bash
make release                     # Run cargo release (minor); git-cliff regenerates CHANGELOG.md inside the release commit
make release LEVEL=patch         # Same flow with a patch bump
make release LEVEL=major         # Same flow with a major bump
cargo release patch --no-confirm # Dry-run cargo release only (no bump/tag/push)
```

Release prep regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` with [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/) (config in `cliff.toml`) inside `cargo release`'s pre-release hook, grouping the commits since the latest `v*` tag under the new version. Conventional prefixes map to grouped sections (`feat` → Features, `fix` → Bug Fixes, `docs` → Documentation, etc.); non-conventional subjects land in `Other` rather than being dropped. git-cliff must be installed locally (`cargo install git-cliff`).

### Native macOS GUI

```bash
make gui-app                     # Build target/gui-app/Stax.app
make install-gui-app             # Install $HOME/Applications/Stax.app
make gui-release                 # Package the native architecture release zip
make gui-release-test            # Validate ad-hoc/signed/notarized configuration + package
stax gui                         # Launch GUI for the current directory
stax gui /path/to/repo           # Launch GUI for an explicit repository
```

Public GitHub Releases include `Stax-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip` and `Stax-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip`; extract the matching archive and move `Stax.app` to `/Applications`, or run `curl -fsSL https://cesarferreira.com/stax/install-gui.sh | sh` on macOS. The app is a separate artifact, not a new package, so it does not enlarge the CLI binaries. Ad-hoc-signed builds must be opened once to trigger Gatekeeper, then approved with **Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**; never disable Gatekeeper globally. The final bundle id is `com.cesarferreira.stax`. The GUI restores its most recent window size and clamps it to the active display after monitor changes.

`stax gui [path]` is macOS-only. It canonicalizes the supplied path, defaults to the current directory, and launches exactly `open -n -b com.cesarferreira.stax --args <canonical-path>`. The `-n` fresh-instance behavior is intentional: every invocation opens a new app process/window for one repository.

GUI operations are typed and repository-scoped. It can search branches; checkout, create, rename, delete, move, and reorder eligible local branches; restack selected/all; submit the current stack as Draft; Open PR without checkout; and undo/redo receipts whose transaction is fully local. Rename does not push. Delete shows descendants. Move/reorder/restack dirty-worktree recovery requires an explicit auto-stash confirmation. `/` focuses search, `1`/`2`/`3` toggle panes, draggable widths and visibility persist per canonical repository, and all enabled visible actions are keyboard-operable with visible focus and textual labels. GUI submit has no CLI prompts and does not auto-open PR pages. Keep AI naming, staging/commit creation, `--below`, `--insert`, custom prefixes, advanced submit options, and remote-effect recovery in CLI workflows.

### Create and Edit Branches

```bash
stax create <name>                 # Create branch stacked on current
stax add <name>                    # Alias for create
stax create -m "message"           # Use commit message (TTY menu if nothing staged)
stax create -a                     # Stage all before creating
stax create -am "message"          # Stage all + commit (bypasses menu)
stax create --ai                   # Generate a branch name from local changes
stax create --ai -a --yes          # Generate branch name + first commit message, stage all
stax create <name> --ai -a         # Keep branch name, generate first commit message
stax create --ai -m "message"      # Keep message, generate branch name
stax create -n -am "message"       # Stage all + commit, skipping hooks
stax create --from <branch>        # Create from explicit base
stax create --prefix feature/      # Override branch prefix
stax create <name> --below         # Insert below current; auto-stashes tracked/untracked work
stax create --below -am "message"  # Auto-stash/apply, stage all, commit on new lower branch
stax bc <name>                     # Hidden shortcut alias
# create -m/-am commits before branch creation, including --from/--below,
# so hook failures or interrupts do not leave orphan branches or -2 retries.
# -m/--ai derived branch names refuse collisions instead of creating -2 duplicates.
# --below keeps prepared work in place by stashing before moving downstack,
# then applying it on the inserted lower branch.

stax m                             # Amend current commit (TTY menu if nothing staged)
stax m -a                          # Stage all + amend (bypasses menu)
stax m -m "new msg"                # Amend with a new commit message

# When nothing is staged and a TTY is attached, `stax create -m` and
# `stax modify` show a menu: Stage all / Select --patch / Continue without
# staging (empty branch OR amend message only) / Abort. Non-TTY callers bail
# with guidance to use `-a` or `git add` first.

stax rename <name>                 # Rename current branch
stax rename --edit                 # Edit commit message while renaming
stax rename --push                 # Push renamed branch + cleanup remote

stax detach [branch] --yes         # Remove branch from stack, keep descendants
stax reorder --yes                 # Reorder stack interactively
stax split                         # Split current branch into multiple stacked branches
```

### Submit, Merge, Sync, Restack

```bash
stax submit                        # Submit full stack
stax ss                            # Alias for submit
stax submit --plan                 # Read-only action plan (no fetch/push/metadata writes)
stax submit --plan --json          # Versioned v2 plan for automation (action strings are extensible)
                                      # Live remote heads are read without fetching; chained restacks and unresolved PR/link decisions are runtime-evaluated
stax submit --draft                # Create draft PRs
stax submit --no-pr                # Push only (no PR create/update)
stax submit --no-fetch             # Skip git fetch
stax submit --no-verify            # Skip pre-push hooks while pushing
stax submit -n                     # Short for --no-verify
stax submit --open                 # Open current PR after submit
stax submit --reviewers a,b        # Set reviewers
stax submit --labels bug,urgent    # Set labels
stax submit --assignees alice      # Set assignees
stax submit --template backend     # Use named PR template
stax submit --no-template          # Skip template picker
stax submit --edit                 # Always edit PR body
stax submit --ai                   # Generate PR title/body with AI
stax submit --ai --title           # Generate/update PR title only
stax submit --ai --body            # Generate/update PR body only
stax submit --ai --yes             # Accept generated new-PR details
stax submit --rerequest-review     # Re-request existing reviewers on update
stax submit --native-stack         # Force-attempt native GitHub Stack registration for this run
stax submit --no-native-stack      # Skip native GitHub Stack registration for this run
stax completions zsh               # Generate completions: bash|zsh|fish|powershell|elvish

# ~/.config/stax/config.toml; repo-root stax.toml overlays shared values
[submit]
stack_links = "body"               # "comment" | "body" | "both" | "off"
single_stack = "on"                # "on" | "off" — when "off", skip stack-link sync while only one PR exists; populates on all PRs as soon as the stack reaches 2
native_stack = "auto"              # "auto" | "off" | "link" — auto-register native GitHub Stacked PRs when gh-stack + repo access are available
stack_links_when_native = "keep"   # "keep" | "off" — keep stax body/comment links when native registration succeeds

# Native GitHub Stacked PRs are additive. Repos/users without access or without
# `github/gh-stack` installed behave exactly as normal stax. `stax doctor --fix`
# can offer `gh extension install github/gh-stack` when `gh` is installed.
# `stax submit --native-stack` still keeps submit non-blocking, but prints an
# actionable note when `gh`, `github/gh-stack`, or `gh stack link` support is missing.
# gh-stack v0.0.8+ uses the public Stacks REST API and preserves normal GitHub
# CLI authentication, including GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN. For known older versions,
# stax strips those overrides before `gh stack` and falls back to a keyring OAuth
# account. `stax doctor` always shows the installed version, marks anything below
# v0.0.8 as out of date, can upgrade it with `stax doctor --fix`, and probes
# legacy OAuth only when token overrides exist.
# Native GitHub Stack updates are append-only. If relinking would remove or insert
# a PR, run `stax stack unlink <stack-number>` and then `stax stack link` again.
# stax prints the repository-scoped Stack number when gh-stack returns it.
# Once linked, GitHub owns base-branch transitions for those PRs and rejects
# any PATCH touching `base` ("...part of a stack"). stax treats this as
# non-fatal in submit/merge cascade retargets (prints a note, continues);
# `stax merge --stack`/`--queue` fail with an actionable message instead,
# since merging out of stack order needs a real base change (run
# `stax stack unlink` first if that's what you want).
# GitHub's native Stack feature only supports one linear chain — if a branch
# in the local stack has two+ children (a fork), stax detects this itself
# and skips native `gh stack link` for that submit (prints a note) rather
# than handing gh-stack a branch set it might silently mis-linearize.
# stax's own body/comment stack links have no such limit and render forked
# siblings at equal depth.

stax branch submit                 # Submit current branch only
stax bs                            # Hidden shortcut alias for branch submit
stax upstack submit                # Submit current + descendants
stax downstack submit              # Submit ancestors + current

# submit can publish temporary rebased heads for branches that need restack;
# local branch tips and metadata are not moved. Scoped submit still requires an
# excluded parent to be remote-synced; otherwise use downstack/full submit or
# restack first.

stax merge --all                   # Merge whole stack
stax merge --downstack-only        # Merge ancestors below current, then rebase current

stax merge --dry-run               # Preview merge plan only
stax merge --method squash         # squash|merge|rebase
stax merge --stack                 # GitHub/GitLab only: target selected items to trunk, merge the tip, preserve merged state
stax merge --stack --method rebase # GitHub only: rewrite SHAs and absorb lower PRs (GitLab rejects rebase/squash)
stax merge --stack --downstack-only # Stack-merge ancestors below current; keep current open
stax merge --stack --full          # Stack-merge full stack even from the middle

stax merge --remote                # Merge via GitHub API only — no local checkout/rebase/push
stax merge --remote --all          # Include full stack (GitHub only)

stax rs                            # Sync trunk + clean merged branches
stax rs --restack                  # Sync then restack
stax sync --continue               # Continue after resolved sync conflicts
stax sync --safe                   # Avoid hard reset on trunk update
stax sync --force                  # Force sync without prompts; preserve linked worktrees during cleanup
stax sync --prune                  # No-op: kept for CLI compatibility (use --full to fetch --prune all remote-tracking refs)
stax sync --full                   # Fetch all remote branches with --prune (slower; default is trunk-only fetch + ls-remote)
stax sync --no-delete              # Keep merged branches
stax sync --auto-stash-pop         # Stash/pop dirty target worktrees
# sync cleanup switches/detaches linked worktrees before deleting merged/gone branches; interactive removal remains explicit.
# Imported support branches may still be deleted locally after merge/gone, but their remotes are never push-deleted.
# The sync footer reports trunk commits/files/line changes plus non-zero cleanup/imported/restack counts.
# Conditional attention lines name blocked cleanup, trunk failures, and checkout changes, followed by one prioritized next command. For a diverged trunk, inspect and reconcile it with its remote instead of treating `st trunk` as a repair; other trunk failures use `st trunk`. Routine restack health stays in stax ls and the TUI.
# When --restack is requested, a failed fetch or trunk that did not reach the fetched remote commit stops sync before imported refresh, merged cleanup, or feature-branch rebases. Any sync auto-stash is restored first.

stax sweep                         # Classify ALL local branches (merged/gone/stale/active) — read-only
stax sweep --delete                # Delete merged/tracked-merged PRs + upstream-gone branches with no unique work after confirmation
stax sweep --delete --include-stale  # Also delete stale branches
stax sweep --delete --force        # Skip confirmation prompt

### AI Worktree Lanes (parallel AI agents)

```bash

stax lane add-dark-mode "Add dark mode"           # Start a named lane with a prompt

stax lane add-dark-mode --agent codex --model gpt-5.5-fast  # Override model too
stax lane add-dark-mode                           # Re-enter the lane (reattaches tmux session)
stax lane add-dark-mode "new prompt" --no-tmux    # Force direct terminal (no tmux)

stax wt ll                                        # Rich status of all lanes
stax wt rs                                        # Restack ALL stax-managed worktrees after trunk moves
stax wt rm add-dark-mode --delete-branch          # Remove worktree + delete branch + metadata

stax wt cleanup                                   # Prune stale entries + remove merged/detached lanes

# Lower-level worktree control
stax wt c review-pass --agent codex -- "address the open PR comments"  # Create + launch agent
stax wt go review-pass --agent codex --tmux       # Re-enter + launch agent in existing lane

# Warm-start dependencies: by default, removing a clean, merged-equivalent
# worktree parks it as a reusable warm slot (reset --hard trunk + `git clean -fd`,
# which keeps gitignored deps like node_modules / .venv) instead of deleting it.
# The next create/lane adopts that slot instead of a cold `git worktree add`, so
# built deps survive. A --force dirty removal never parks.
#
# Optional ~/.config/stax/config.toml or repo-root stax.toml overrides:
[worktree]
reuse_slots = false               # disable recycling (cold create + real remove)
max_idle_slots = 4                # cap on parked idle slots
reconcile = "pnpm install"        # non-fatal deps re-sync on adopt
```

### Maintenance, Safety, and Setup

```bash

stax abort                         # Abort in-progress rebase/conflict flow

stax undo                          # Undo last risky operation
stax undo <op-id>                  # Undo a specific operation
stax undo --no-push                # Undo locally only
stax redo                          # Re-apply last undone operation
stax redo <op-id> --no-push        # Redo locally only

stax validate                      # Validate stack metadata health (read-only; never prunes refs)
stax fix --dry-run                 # Preview metadata repairs
stax fix --yes                     # Apply metadata repairs non-interactively

stax test -- cargo test -p my-crate

stax auth --token <token>          # Save GitHub PAT
stax auth --from-gh                # Import from gh auth token
stax auth status                   # Show active auth source
stax config                        # Print config location + values
stax cli upgrade                   # Upgrade using the detected install method, then refresh shell setup

```

## Common Workflows

### Start a New Feature Stack

```bash
stax t
stax rs
stax create api-layer
# ...changes...
stax m
stax create ui-layer
# ...changes...
stax m
stax ss
```

### Update Reviewed Branch and Re-request Review

```bash
stax co <branch>
# ...fixes...
stax m
stax ss --rerequest-review
```

### Merge with Safety Gates (CI + approvals)

```bash
stax ready
stax merge --when-ready --interval 15
stax merge --stack --when-ready    # GitHub/GitLab stack merge: selected tip CI only, preserving merge
```

### After Base PR Merges

```bash
stax refresh
# `stax update` is a back-compat alias for `stax refresh`.
```

### Resolve Rebase Conflicts

```bash
stax restack
# ...resolve conflicts...
git add -A
stax continue
```

If stax detects that the stored `parentBranchRevision` would replay much more
history than `merge-base(parent, branch)`, it prints a `preflight:` notice and
automatically uses the merge-base boundary for that rebase. This is the common
cause of “conflicts on files I never edited” after `git merge main` into a
branch or late tracking.

Silence the notice with `[restack] preflight_warn = false` or `--quiet`.
Disable the automatic correction with `[restack] preflight_auto_repair = false`
only when debugging old boundary behaviour.

### Repair Broken Metadata

```bash
stax validate
stax fix --dry-run
stax fix --yes
```

### Work on Multiple Stacks in Parallel (Developer Worktrees)

```bash
# One-time shell integration (enables transparent cd)
stax setup
stax setup --yes               # Shell integration + skills + auth import from gh when available
stax setup --install-skills    # Non-interactive onboarding: shell integration + AI agent skills

# Create a worktree for an existing local branch
stax worktree create feature/payments-api

# Create a local tracking branch and worktree from a fetched remote branch
stax worktree create origin/feature/payments-api

# List all worktrees
stax w

# Jump to a worktree
stax worktree go payments-api
# or with the shell alias:
sw payments-api

# All stax commands work normally inside worktrees
stax restack --all
stax ss

# Hand this branch back to the main worktree (both checkouts must be clean)
stax worktree promote

# Clean up
stax worktree remove payments-api
```

### Run Multiple AI Agents in Parallel

Each agent gets its own isolated worktree and branch. They cannot conflict.

```bash
# 1. Start one lane per task — stax creates the worktree, branch, and launches the agent
stax lane add-dark-mode --agent codex "Add dark mode"
stax lane fix-auth-refresh --agent claude "Fix auth refresh edge case"
stax lane write-integration-tests "Write integration tests for checkout flow"

# 2. Check status while agents run
stax wt ll           # rich status of all lanes (tmux state, dirty/clean, branch)
stax status          # all three branches appear in the normal stack tree

# 3. Reattach to a session later
stax lane            # interactive picker — fuzzy, shows tmux + status columns
stax lane fix-auth-refresh  # jump directly back to that lane

# 4. Trunk moved — restack everything at once
stax wt rs

# 5. Review and submit each branch normally
stax checkout add-dark-mode
stax submit

# 6. Clean up
stax wt rm add-dark-mode --delete-branch
stax wt cleanup      # bulk-remove merged/detached lanes
```

## Reading Stack Output

```
◉  feature/validation 1↑         # ◉ = current branch, 1↑ = commits ahead of parent
○  feature/auth 2↑ 1↓ ⟳          # ⟳ = needs restack
○  feature/old-base (missing parent: feature/base)
│ ○    ☁ wt feature/payments PR #42 # ☁ = has remote, wt/󰙅 = linked worktree, PR #N = open PR
○─┘    ☁ main                    # trunk branch
```

Symbols:

- `◉` = current branch
- `○` = other branch
- `☁` = has remote tracking
- `wt` / Nerd Font tree icon = checked out in a linked worktree (`display.worktree_glyph` in config)
- `↑` = commits ahead of parent
- `↓` = commits behind parent
- `⟳` = needs restacking (parent changed)
- `(missing parent: X)` = branch metadata points to a deleted/missing parent; run `stax fix --yes`
- `PR #N` = open PR

## Best Practices

1. Keep branches small and reviewable.
2. Sync often (`stax rs`).
3. Restack after merges (`stax rs --restack`); squash-merged local parents collapse to their updated parent before descendants rebase.
4. Prefer amend flow (`stax m`) to keep one commit per branch.
5. Validate and repair metadata (`stax validate`, `stax fix`) before deep stack surgery. Validation is read-only; only `fix` removes orphaned refs.
6. Check stack shape (`stax ls` / `stax ll`) before submit or merge.
7. Use `stax lane <name> [prompt]` to give each AI agent its own isolated worktree — prevents agents from conflicting on the same files.
8. After trunk moves, run `stax wt rs` once instead of rebasing each agent worktree manually.
9. Use `stax worktree create` when you want a worktree for an existing local branch, fetched remote branch, or human parallel development — `st lane` is the higher-level AI shortcut.
10. Use `stax worktree promote` inside a clean lane to retire it and continue its branch in the main worktree without losing stax or PR metadata.
11. Run `stax setup` once per machine to enable `stax worktree go`, `stax worktree promote`, and the `sw` alias to move the parent shell automatically.

## Tips

- Run `stax` with no args to launch the interactive TUI; selected-branch CI hydrates in the background, unchanged branch diffs can be reused from the repo-local TUI cache on reopen, and `1`/`2`/`3` toggle the Stack/Summary/Patch panes for small terminals. Pane visibility is remembered per repo.
- Run `stax gui [path]` on macOS to launch a fresh installed GUI window for one repository. A pathless app launch restores the last project; use the toolbar project dropdown to switch recent repositories or add another. Use `/` for search, `1`/`2`/`3` for persistent pane toggles, and the guarded controls, menus, or shortcuts for structural operations and local-only undo/redo.
- Use `stax --help` or `stax <command> --help` for exact flags.
- Add global `--trace` to profile instrumented Git subprocesses and total command time; use `make benchmark-status` for reproducible cold status scaling fixtures.
- Hidden convenience shortcuts: `stax bc`, `stax bu`, `stax bd`, `stax bs`, `stax w`, `stax wtc`, `stax wtgo`, `stax wtrm`.
- Use `--yes` for non-interactive scripting.
- Use `--json` on supported commands for machine-readable output.
- Use `stax lane` with no arguments for an interactive picker over all stax-managed lanes — useful when you forget where a session lives.
- Use `stax worktree go` (or `sw`) + shell integration to switch between stacks without `cd` gymnastics.
- Use `stax worktree promote` when a lane should become the main-worktree checkout; it refuses dirty or conflicted checkouts instead of stashing automatically. If Git reports a removal failure after already retiring the lane, Stax keeps the completed promotion and warns you to inspect leftover files.
- `stax worktree list` shows ALL worktrees including those created externally via `git worktree add`.
