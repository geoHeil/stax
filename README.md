## Why stax

One giant PR is slow to review and risky to merge. A stack of small PRs is the answer — but managing stacks by hand with `git rebase --onto` is a footgun. **stax** makes stacks a first-class Git primitive.

- **Stack, don't wait.** Keep shipping on top of in-review PRs. `st create`, `st ss`, done.
- **Native-fast.** A single Rust binary that starts in ~25ms. `st ls` benches ~70× faster than Graphite and ~215× faster than Freephite on this repo.
- **Agent-native.** Run parallel AI agents on isolated branches (`st lane`), auto-resolve rebase conflicts (`st resolve`), and generate branch names, commit messages, and PR details from real diffs.
- **GitHub-native stacks, automatically.** When your repo has GitHub's native Stacked PRs enabled and `github/gh-stack` is installed, `st ss` registers the stack with GitHub under the hood — zero config, zero extra commands. See [Native GitHub Stacked PRs](#native-github-stacked-prs).
- **Undo-first.** Every destructive op snapshots state. `st undo` / `st redo` rescue risky rebases instantly.
- **Batteries-included TUI.** Run bare `st` to browse the stack, inspect diffs, and watch CI hydrate live.

> `stax` installs two binaries: `stax` and the short alias `st`. This README uses `st`.

## Install

The shortest path on macOS and Linux:

```bash
brew install cesarferreira/tap/stax
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Other installation methods</strong> — cargo-binstall, prebuilt binaries, Windows, from source</summary>

### cargo-binstall

```bash
cargo binstall stax
```

### Prebuilt binaries

Download the latest binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax/releases):

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax/releases/latest/download/stax-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz | tar xz
# macOS (Intel)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax/releases/latest/download/stax-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz | tar xz
# Linux (x86_64)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax/releases/latest/download/stax-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar xz
# Linux (arm64)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax/releases/latest/download/stax-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar xz

mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv stax st ~/.local/bin/
# Ensure ~/.local/bin is on your PATH:
# echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**Windows (x86_64):** download `stax-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax/releases), extract `stax.exe` and `st.exe`, and place them on your `PATH`. See [Windows notes](#windows-notes).

### Build from source

Prereqs:
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config`
- Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install openssl-devel`
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S openssl pkg-config`
- macOS: OpenSSL included

Then:

```bash
cargo install --path . --locked
# or
make install
```

No system OpenSSL? Use the vendored feature:

```bash
cargo install --path . --locked --features vendored-openssl
```

</details>

Verify the install:

```bash
st --version
```

### Native macOS GUI

One-liner:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cesarferreira.com/stax/install-gui.sh | sh
```

Manual install: download the architecture-specific app from the same [GitHub Release](https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax/releases/latest) as the CLI. For Apple Silicon:

```bash
curl -fLO https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax/releases/latest/download/Stax-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip
ditto -x -k Stax-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip .
mv Stax.app /Applications/
```

On an Intel Mac, use `Stax-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip` instead. The app is a separate release artifact, not a new crates.io package, and installing it does not enlarge the `stax` or `st` CLI binaries.

Ad-hoc-signed releases are supported. Download only from the project Releases page, move the app to `/Applications`, and try to open it once. Then use **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** for Stax, authenticate, and confirm **Open**. The override is available for about an hour after the blocked launch. Do not disable Gatekeeper globally. Releases open normally when the optional signing and notarization credentials are configured.

Contributors can also build or install the app locally:

```bash
make gui-app           # Build target/gui-app/Stax.app
make install-gui-app   # Build and install $HOME/Applications/Stax.app
st gui [path]          # Launch a fresh Stax.app instance for one repository
```

The bundle id is `com.cesarferreira.stax`. `st gui [path]` is macOS-only; it canonicalizes the supplied path, defaults to the current directory when omitted, and launches LaunchServices as `open -n -b com.cesarferreira.stax --args <canonical-path>`. The `-n` flag is intentional: every invocation starts a fresh app process/window for exactly one repository.

<a id="quickstart"></a>
## Quickstart

`st setup` handles shell integration, AI agent skills, and GitHub auth in a single step:

```bash
st setup --yes
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative auth options</summary>

```bash
# Import from GitHub CLI
gh auth login && st auth --from-gh

# Enter a token interactively
st auth

# Or via env var
export STAX_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxx"
```

By default stax ignores ambient `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Opt in with `auth.allow_github_token_env = true`.

</details>

Now ship a two-branch stack end-to-end:

```bash
# 1. Stack two branches on trunk
st create auth-api
st create auth-ui

# 2. See the stack
st ls
# ◉  auth-ui        1↑
# ○  auth-api       1↑
# ○  main

# 3. Submit the whole stack as linked PRs
st ss

# 4. After the bottom PR merges on GitHub…
st refresh         # sync trunk, restack this stack, update PRs (`st update` is a back-compat alias)
```

Picked the wrong trunk? Run `st trunk main` or `st init --trunk <branch>` to reconfigure.

Next: [Quick Start guide](docs/getting-started/quick-start.md) · [Merge & cascade workflow](docs/workflows/merge-and-cascade.md)

## Highlights

### Parallel AI lanes

Spin up multiple AI agents on isolated branches, all tracked as normal stax branches:

```bash
st lane fix-auth-refresh "Fix the token refresh edge case from #142"
st lane stabilize-ci     "Stabilize the 3 flaky tests in the checkout flow"
st lane api-docs         "Update API docs for the /users endpoint"
```

Each lane is a real Git worktree with normal stax metadata — it appears in `st ls`, participates in restack/sync/undo, and re-attaches via tmux any time. No hidden scratch directories, no lost work.

```bash
st wt         # open the worktree dashboard
st wt rs      # restack every lane at once when trunk moves
st wt promote # move the current lane branch back to the main worktree
st ss         # submit PRs for the ones that are ready
```

Lanes start warm: instead of deleting a removed worktree, stax parks it as a reusable warm slot (resetting it to trunk and running `git clean -fd`, which keeps gitignored dependency directories like `node_modules` or `.venv`). The next lane adopts that slot instead of a cold checkout, so agents keep their built deps and don't re-install from scratch. Set `worktree.reconcile` to re-sync deps on adopt, or `worktree.reuse_slots = false` to opt out.

→ [Agent worktrees](docs/workflows/agent-worktrees.md) · [Multi-worktree workflow](docs/workflows/multi-worktree.md)

<a id="native-github-stacked-prs"></a>
### Native GitHub Stacked PRs

When a GitHub repo has native Stacked PRs enabled, stax can register your submitted PRs as a native GitHub Stack automatically. This requires GitHub's [`github/gh-stack`](https://github.com/github/gh-stack) CLI extension — install it once:

```bash
gh extension install github/gh-stack
# or let stax install it for you:
st doctor --fix
```

That's it — no config needed. From then on, `st ss`/`st bs` auto-link multi-PR stacks under the hood, no extra command required. Existing stax PR body/comment stack links keep working; the native GitHub stack map is added on top. On gh-stack v0.0.8+, stax also prints the repository-scoped Stack number returned by GitHub.

```bash
st ss                    # auto-links native stack when available
st stack link            # manually re-link the current stack
st stack unlink 7        # unstack native Stack #7 remotely
```

Repos without the feature, users without the extension, and non-GitHub remotes keep the existing stax behavior — this is purely additive and never blocks a submit. `gh-stack` v0.0.8+ uses GitHub's public Stacks REST API and supports the normal GitHub CLI authentication sources, including `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`. For older link-capable versions, stax strips those overrides before `gh stack` operations so the extension can fall back to an OAuth-authenticated `gh` login. `st doctor` always shows the installed version, marks anything below v0.0.8 as out of date, and can upgrade it with `st doctor --fix`. Native Stack updates are append-only; to remove or insert PRs, run `st stack unlink <stack-number>` and then link again. Argument-free `st stack unlink` retains the active locally tracked behavior.

→ [Native GitHub Stacks guide](docs/integrations/github-native-stacks.md)

### Cascade stack merge

Merge from the bottom of the stack up to your current branch, with CI and readiness checks:

```bash
st merge                  # local cascade merge
st merge --when-ready     # wait/poll until PRs are mergeable
st merge --ds             # merge ancestors, rebase current branch
st merge --stack          # GitHub/GitLab: preserve lower PR/MR merged state through one tip merge
st merge --stack --full   # stack-merge the full stack even from the middle
st merge --remote         # merge remotely on GitHub while you keep working
st merge --all            # merge the whole stack regardless of position
```

GitLab stack merge checks project merge settings first, sends `squash: false`,
and accepts only the default preserving method; explicit stack `rebase` or
`squash` is rejected. Gitea/Forgejo stack merge is not supported.

→ [Merge and cascade](docs/workflows/merge-and-cascade.md)

### AI conflict resolution

When a rebase stops on a conflict, `st resolve` sends only the conflicted text files to your configured AI agent, applies the result, and resumes the rebase automatically. If the AI returns invalid output, touches a non-conflicted file, or leaves extra conflicts behind, stax bails out and preserves the in-progress rebase so you can inspect or continue manually.

```bash
st resolve
st resolve --agent codex --model gpt-5.3-codex
```

Before each rebase, stax also runs a **preflight repair** that compares the
stored parent boundary against `merge-base(parent, branch)`. When they diverge
sharply — the “my restack hit conflicts on files I never touched” case — stax
automatically uses the merge-base boundary for that rebase and prints a
one-line notice. Silence the notice with `[restack] preflight_warn = false` or
`--quiet`; disable the automatic correction with
`[restack] preflight_auto_repair = false`.

### Undo / redo

`restack`, `submit`, and `reorder` each snapshot branch state before they touch anything. Recovery is one command away.

```bash
st restack
st undo
st redo
```

→ [Undo/redo safety](docs/safety/undo-redo.md)

### Interactive TUI

<p align="center">
  <img alt="stax TUI" src="assets/tui.png" width="760">
</p>

Bare `st` launches a full-screen TUI for browsing stacks, inspecting branch summaries and cached patches, watching live CI hydrate, and running common ops without leaving the terminal. Stack/Summary/Patch pane visibility is remembered per repo.

→ [TUI guide](docs/interface/tui.md)

### Native macOS GUI

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Stax native macOS GUI showing a stacked branch graph, changes, and branch inspector" src="assets/gui.png" width="960">
</p>

The native GUI opens a repository-scoped workspace with searchable Stack, Changes, and Inspector panes. It can check out, create, rename, delete, move, and reorder local branches; restack the selected branch or all tracked branches; submit the current stack as Draft; open the selected PR; and safely undo or redo fully local recorded operations. Destructive and history-rewriting actions show exact previews and confirmations, including explicit auto-stash follow-ups for dirty move/reorder/restack flows.

When the app starts without an explicit path, it reopens the most recently used project. Use the project dropdown in the toolbar to switch between recent projects or choose **Add Project…** to open another repository. An explicit `st gui <path>` launch still opens that repository.

Use `/` to search, `1`/`2`/`3` to toggle panes, and drag dividers to resize them; visibility and widths persist per canonical repository. The app also restores its last window size and reduces it to fit the current display after a monitor change. Native menus and keyboard shortcuts dispatch the same typed actions as the buttons. Submit is always confirmed first, pushes the current stack as Draft, and does not show CLI prompts or auto-open PR pages. `st gui [path]` only launches the app.

→ [GUI guide](docs/interface/gui.md)

### AI branch names, PR details, and standups

```bash
st create --ai -a --yes   # generate branch name + first commit message
st ss --ai --yes          # generate PR titles/bodies during submit
st gen                    # interactive: PR body, PR title, or commit message (AI)
st generate --pr-body     # non-interactive: refresh PR body from branch diff + context
st generate --pr-title    # non-interactive: refresh PR title from branch diff
st generate --commit-msg  # non-interactive: amend HEAD commit message with AI
st standup --ai           # spoken-style daily engineering summary
st standup --ai --style slack  # Slack-ready Yesterday/Today bullets
```

Each AI feature (`generate`, `standup`, `resolve`, `lane`) can use a different agent/model. `st create --ai`, `st submit --ai`, and `st generate` / `st gen` (PR body/title, commit message) share the `generate` setting. Configure with:

```bash
st config --set-ai
```

## Performance

Benchmarked with `hyperfine` on this repo. Absolute times vary by repo and machine; the ratios do not.

Run `make benchmark-status` for deterministic cold 10/50/100-branch scaling
fixtures, or add global `--trace` to a command to see instrumented Git
subprocess and wall-clock timings.

| Benchmark      | stax     | vs [Freephite](https://github.com/bradymadden97/freephite) | vs [Graphite](https://github.com/withgraphite/graphite-cli) |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| `st ls`        | baseline | **214.76×** faster | **69.72×** faster |
| `st rs` (sync) | baseline | **2.41×** faster  | —              |

stax is wire-compatible with Freephite/Graphite for common stacked-branch workflows.

## Configuration

```bash
st config                  # open the config editor
st config --set-ai         # pick AI agent + model
st config --reset-ai       # clear saved AI pairing and re-prompt
st --default-config       # print the default config.toml to stdout
```

Config lives at `~/.config/stax/config.toml`. When `STAX_CONFIG_DIR` is unset,
a repo-root `stax.toml` overlays only the values it sets:

```toml
[submit]
stack_links = "body"   # "comment" | "body" | "both" | "off"
single_stack = "on"    # "on" | "off" — when "off", skip stack-link sync while only one PR exists
```

→ [Full config reference](docs/configuration/index.md)

## Integrations

### tmux

[**stax.tmux**](https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax.tmux) is a TPM-compatible plugin that puts your stack in the tmux status bar and adds keybindings for common actions:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/tmux.png" width="880" alt="stax.tmux status bar">
</p>

- Live status bar — branch, stack position, PR state, CI state; auto-refreshes in the background
- Keybindings — `prefix + S` popup, `prefix + ]`/`[` up/down, `prefix + M-s` sync
- Window auto-rename — tmux window title follows the current branch

Install via TPM:

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'cesarferreira/stax.tmux'
```

See the [stax.tmux README](https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax.tmux) for full setup and configuration options.

<summary><strong>Windows notes</strong> — shell integration, worktrees, tmux</summary>

stax runs on Windows (x86_64) with prebuilt binaries on [Releases](https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax/releases). Most commands work identically, with these limitations:

- **Shell integration is not available.** `st setup` supports bash/zsh/fish only. On Windows:
  - `st wt c` / `st wt go` create and navigate worktrees but cannot auto-`cd` the parent shell. `st wt promote` performs the handoff but likewise requires the printed `cd` command.
  - The `sw` quick alias is not available.
  - `st wt rm` (bare) cannot relocate the shell. Specify: `st wt rm <name>`.
- **Worktree commands still work.** `st wt c/go/ls/ll/promote/cleanup/rm/prune/restack` all function — only the shell-level `cd` is missing.
- **tmux integration requires WSL** or a Unix-like environment. The [stax.tmux](https://github.com/cesarferreira/stax.tmux) plugin is Unix-only.

Everything else — stacked branches, PRs, restack, sync, undo/redo, TUI, AI generation — works on Windows without limitation.

</details>

## Contributing

Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
make test
```

On macOS this uses Docker when available. `make test-native` is the guarded
fallback: it checks the file-descriptor limit, sanitizes the environment, and
runs nextest with the optimized test profile. Native macOS timings can still
vary substantially with endpoint-security tooling, so Docker remains the
recommended full-suite path.

To cut a release, run:

```bash
make release                  # default minor bump
make release LEVEL=patch      # patch bump
make release LEVEL=major      # major bump
```

Release automation regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` with [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/) inside `cargo release`'s pre-release hook, grouping the commits since the latest `v*` tag under the new version (config in [`cliff.toml`](cliff.toml)). See [docs/workflows/releasing.md](docs/workflows/releasing.md).
