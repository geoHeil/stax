# Core commands

Day-to-day commands you'll use most. For the exhaustive list of every command, subcommand, and flag, see the [full reference](reference.md).

## Stack view and creation

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `st` | Launch the interactive TUI |
| `st gui [path]` | Launch a fresh native macOS GUI window for a repository |
| `st ls` | Show stack with PR, rebase, and metadata-repair status |
| `st ll` | Like `st ls` plus PR URLs and detail |
| `st create <name>` / `st add <name>` | Create a branch stacked on current |
| `st create --ai -a --yes` | Generate branch name + first commit message |
| `st create <name> --below` | Insert a new branch below current, carrying tracked/untracked prepared changes with it |
| `st get [branch|PR]` | Sync the current stack, or fetch a branch/PR stack from remote without overwriting local commits |

If you discover a hotfix while working upstack, keep the edits in place:

```bash
st create cve-hotfix --below
st create --below -am "fix: patch CVE-2026-0001"
```

`--below` auto-stashes prepared tracked and untracked changes before moving to the lower base, then reapplies them on the inserted branch. With `-am`, those changes are staged and committed on the new lower branch.
When `-m` or `--ai` derives a branch name that already exists, Stax stops instead of creating a suffixed duplicate; pass an explicit different name or checkout/reparent the existing branch.

## Submit and merge

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `st ss` | Submit the whole stack — open or update linked PRs |
| `st stack link` | Register the current PR stack as a native GitHub Stack when `gh-stack` is available |
| `st stack unlink [<stack-number>]` | Unstack a remote native Stack by number, or the active locally tracked stack when omitted |
| `st branch submit` | Submit only the current branch; if its parent is already synced to the remote, Stax may publish a temporary rebased head without moving your local branch |
| `st upstack submit` | Submit current branch and descendants; descendants are temporarily chained onto any temporary parent publish heads |
| `st draft [branch]` | Convert the current (or named) branch's PR to draft |
| `st draft --stack` | Convert every PR in the current stack to draft |
| `st undraft [branch]` | Mark the current (or named) branch's PR as ready for review |
| `st undraft --stack` | Mark every PR in the current stack as ready for review |
| `st ready` | Interactive PR readiness dashboard — CI, review approval, and merge state for all tracked branches; auto-refreshes every 15s and stays open until you quit (`q`) |
| `st merge` | Cascade-merge from stack bottom up to current branch |
| `st merge --when-ready` | Wait for CI + approvals, then merge (alias: `st mwr`) |
| `st merge --downstack-only` / `--ds` | Merge ancestors below current, then rebase current branch |
| `st merge --stack` | Target selected PRs/MRs to trunk and merge the tip with SHA-preserving `merge`, allowing GitHub or GitLab to mark lower items merged (`--full` includes descendants) |
| `st merge --remote` | Merge remotely via the GitHub API while you keep working |
| `st merge --all` | Merge the entire stack regardless of where you are |
| `st cascade` | Restack, push, and create/update PRs in one shot (no trunk fetch; offline-friendly) |

Scoped submit keeps local branch metadata unchanged when it prepares a temporary publish head. Plain `git commit` work on the branch is included; `st restack` remains the command that updates local branch tips and parent revisions.

On GitHub repos with native Stacked PRs enabled, `st ss`/`st bs` auto-register the submitted PRs with GitHub via `gh stack link` when the `github/gh-stack` extension is installed. Repos without access or users without the extension keep the normal stax stack links and see no behavior change. `gh-stack` v0.0.8+ supports normal GitHub CLI authentication, including token environment variables; stax keeps its token-stripping OAuth fallback only for known older versions. `st doctor` always reports the installed version and marks versions below v0.0.8 as out of date. `st stack unlink <stack-number>` delegates to v0.0.8's remote unstack operation without requiring local tracking; omit the number to target the active locally tracked stack. See [Native GitHub Stacked PRs](../integrations/github-native-stacks.md).

## Sync, restack, update

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `st rs` | Pull trunk, clean merged branches, reparent children |
| `st rs --restack` | `rs` **plus** rebase the current stack onto updated trunk |
| `st rs --delete-upstream-gone` | Also delete local branches whose upstream is gone |
| `st restack` | Rebase current stack onto parents locally (no fetch) |
| `st refresh` | Sync trunk without merged-branch cleanup, restack, then push and update PRs (`st update` is a back-compat alias) |
| `st refresh --force --yes --no-prompt` | Full refresh flow without sync or submit prompts |
| `st refresh --verbose` | Same as `st refresh`, with detailed sync/restack/submit timing |

## Branch housekeeping

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `st sweep` | Classify all local branches: merged, upstream-gone, stale, active (read-only) |
| `st sweep --delete` | Delete merged branches (including tracked merged PRs) and upstream-gone branches with no unique work after confirmation |
| `st sweep --delete --include-stale` | Also delete stale branches (older than threshold) |
| `st sweep --delete --force` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `st sweep --stale-days 60` | Override stale threshold (default 30, or `branch.stale_days` in config) |
| `st sweep --json` | Machine-readable output of all classified branches |

## Navigation and recovery

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `st init` | Initialize stax or reconfigure the trunk |
| `st undo` / `st redo` | Rescue or reapply the last risky operation |
| `st resolve` | AI-resolve an in-progress rebase conflict and continue |
| `st abort` | Abort an in-progress rebase or conflict resolution |
| `st detach` | Remove a branch from the stack, reparent its children |

## Reporting and utility

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `st standup` | Summarize recent activity (`--ai` for AI version, `--ai --style slack` for Slack-ready bullets) |
| `st pr` / `st pr body` / `st pr list` / `st pr list --ready` | Open current PR in browser · view/edit PR body · list open PRs · live CI/PR readiness |
| `st issue list` | List open issues |
| `st changelog` | Generate changelog between refs or fuzzy-find commits with `find` / `--find` |
| `st open` | Open the repository in the browser |
| `st run <cmd>` | Run a command on each branch in the stack (alias: `st test <cmd>`) |
| `st doctor` / `st doctor --fix` | Check repo/config health; `--fix` applies safe local repairs after one confirmation |
| `st demo` | Interactive tutorial — no auth or repo required |

`st ready` and `st pr list --ready` open an interactive TUI showing CI status, review approval (e.g. "1 approval", "missing review"), and recommended next action for each tracked PR. The TUI auto-refreshes every 15s and stays open after CI passes — press `q` to quit. Use `--current` or `--stack` to limit to the current stack. Use `--plain` for a single static table (safe for capture/pipes) and `--json` for the machine-readable readiness schema. Use `--interval <secs>` to change the auto-refresh interval.

`st gui [path]` is macOS-only and launches the installed app with bundle id `com.cesarferreira.stax`. Run `curl -fsSL https://cesarferreira.com/stax/install-gui.sh | sh`, download `Stax-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip` or `Stax-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip` from GitHub Releases and move `Stax.app` to `/Applications`, or use `make install-gui-app` for `$HOME/Applications/Stax.app`. A pathless app launch restores the most recently opened project, and the toolbar project dropdown switches among recent repositories or adds another with the folder picker. The GUI can search and inspect stacks; check out, create, rename, delete, move, and reorder local branches; restack selected/all; submit Draft PRs; Open PR without checkout; and safely undo/redo fully local receipts. Pane visibility and widths persist per repository, while visible controls, native menus, and shortcuts use the same enabled-state rules.
